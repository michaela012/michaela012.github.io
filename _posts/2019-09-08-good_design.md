Everyone loves sunlight sometimes, but not always. Even when you do want light, it can be hard to get just the right amount-- depending on where the sun is in the sky, whether you want direct or indirect light, and whether you're concerned about privacy. Plus, you also want windows that look decently nice. In a dorm, you want something that's especially durable and easy to clean. 

These shutters have it all. They can open and close with the little handles on each side, and you can adjust which way the slats are turned by pulling on the subtle wooden bar in the middle of each panel. It's intuitive, unobtrusive, and does just what you'd expect.
