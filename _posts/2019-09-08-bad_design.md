These photos, featuring a feeble attempt at marking the building entrance for accessibility, were taken outside of Mission, a dining hall and freshman dorm. 

This strikes me as especially bad design for several reasons. First, the sole purpose of this signage is to guide those who need an accessible building entrance to such an entrance. The small, poorly-lit sign isn't helpful, though, because the only thing it points to is a road; there's no path to another door or ramp, just an uneven stretch of grass that leads to a service truck delivery zone. 

Assuming one is supposed to go to the delivery zone in order to get into the building, it'd be difficult-near-impossible to move a wheelchair along that grass. The only other option is the road, but this too couldn't be reached in a wheelchair, considering the height of the curb. 

The bad design here is both the entrance itself and the signage. The entrance clearly wasn't designed with accessibility in mind, and the sign, rather than providing helpful guidance to a more suitable entrance, only reinforces the innacessibility by providing no more than an unwelcoming pointer to nowhere.
