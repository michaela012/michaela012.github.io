# Challenge
If you're living in a city or other populated area, there's almost always going to be other people with whom you share interests and hobbies. If you want to learn a new skill, there are probably groups centered around that as well. The difficulty is that it can be challenging to find and connect with active groups focused on these things. Similarly, it can be difficult for groups to advertise themselves and make people aware of their club-- and if people do hear about the organization, it can be hard to give a clear sense of what the atmosphere is like and make them feel comfortable coming for the first time.

# Solution
My proposal is an app focused on connecting people with groups of others who have shared interests, including both groups that meet regularly and people wanting to connect for one-time events (like community service events, or groups' performances/shows/competitions that are open to the public). There would be a search functionality so that users could look for groups or events based on their specific interests and availability, and a location tagging function, so that groups could attach their information and some form of media to places they've been, in order to give the user a quick introduction to who they are. For example, an illustrators group could post a series of pictures featuring their subject and members' different interpretation of it. A biking group could add pictures of the size of the group that usually comes, the route itself, and what they do together afterwards. A climbing group could tag one of the locations they've been to so that the app user could see pictures of people climbing or bouldering while looking at the location in real life. This would make it easier for a user to 'stumble' across an organization that may be both interesting and convenient to them, but that they might not have thought to search for specifically. It also allows the potentially interested person to get a sense for what the environment of the group is like, and whether they think it might be a good fit for them.

# Use Cases
Figure 1 shows a writers group website, taken from [Morningside Writers webpage](https://www.morningsidewriters.com/html/screenwriting.html). This is one of the first pages that appear when searching for a writers group. However, this website doesn't tell the user what the writing group is like, or give a very clear sense of whether it may be a good fit, as it feels impersonal. This, however, is seemingly a more established/ institutionalized writer's group; perhaps the tone conveyed by the site is appropriate for the demographic they are trying to attract. In that case, it would not be a good fit for someone looking for a more casual community of writers. How could one find such a group, when those communities are not as likely to show up as the result of a google search? An app like this would give both a way for smaller groups to make themselves discoverable, and a way to show what the environment of the group is like (thus benefitting both the group and the potential member).
