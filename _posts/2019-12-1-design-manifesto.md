Designers are always learning new pieces of information as they work to understand the problem they’re focusing on and design a solution. This process can be long and have many complex parts, and it could be easy to get lost in the details and lose sight of broader goals if the design team doesn’t work to maintain a broader focus. If you want a great solution, that can’t happen! 

Having a clear set of tenets can help to keep the process focused. We’ve relied on many different principles in the process of designing Clink!, an event scheduling app created for Iris Howley’s HCI course. Of these, five that I think are most valuable include: 
1. Ethics: consider the consequences of your choices, broader impact, etc.
2. Accessibility: consider all users, and be aware of who you are (and are not) designing for
3. Don’t be precious about your ideas in the initial phase of design
4. An iterative process is key
5. Approach design looking for the real problem, not a solution


*Point 1: Take an ethical approach to the design process*

During the design process, it is important to consider ethics in many ways. First, the research process should be grounded in a well-thought, ethical approach. This means being selective with who you choose to interview and being mindful of any researcher-interlocutor positional differences. One way this can be carried out is to ensure that you have given participants a clear description of the work that you are doing and clearly outlining your expectations for them prior to their agreeing to participate. It is important to make these expectations known prior to asking them to commit to being a part of the project, as people are likely to feel pressure to continue if they have already agreed without knowing details.

Beyond the research process, it’s also essential to consider the ethical implications of the design itself. Unintended consequences are to be expected in some form. Such side-effects of a design choice are not necessarily negative, but it is important for a designer to recognize that the potential for negative effects does exist and work to the best of their ability to identify what such effects might be. This is something that the entire team working on the design should be thinking about as they make even small decisions, but it could also be helpful to bring in outside perspectives to try and catch things the design team has missed. 


*Point 2: Consider the limitations of your design (designing for accessibility)*

Throughout the design process, designers should be aware of which groups they are designing for, and which groups they are not. Ideally we would want to create a design that works for everyone, but this is often not possible since many user groups have different needs. This makes it so that the question of accessibility should be a key part of the design process. Who, or which groups, are being privileged? If the designers are thinking about accessibility, it better positions them to consider these questions carefully and intentionally. It also makes it so that when there are aspects of the design that could be changed to meet the needs of one group without conflicting with others, the designers would be more able to recognize and implement those changes. These choices could relate to anything ranging from color palette selection to the addition alt-text. Sometimes relatively simple changes like these could make the difference for a group’s ability to use a design, or to significantly augment their experience. 

For Clink!, we knew that we wanted our app to be accessible by all ages and that people with many different levels of familiarity with tech would be using the product. Because of this, we wanted to make our design as clean and streamlined as possible: we chose a minimalist look with a limited color scheme and large buttons and text size. The use of main heading for each item in the event calendar would also aid accessibility for those using screen readers.

*Point 3: Don’t be precious about initial ideas*

After developing an understanding of the problem, it would be easy for a designer to come up with an idea that they think addresses all the relevant issues and want to focus only on developing that idea. However, we’ve learned that often the best ideas are usually not the ones we come up with first! In fact, the best ideas usually come from pulling good aspects of many earlier ones and combining them to create a more comprehensive solution. Finding the best solution will not be possible if a designer gets too stuck on an initial idea and isn’t willing to make wholesale changes.  

It’s hard to throw away things you care about! We put a lot of effort into [each sketch](https://clink-app.github.io/2019-10-07-project-ideation/) and [test design](https://clink-app.github.io/2019-10-10-project-design-check-in/) we created, and it wasn’t easy to know that most of them would be discarded or changed. But the effort wasn’t wasted! You need this process in order to distill the main ideas and get to what really matters. Each idea and test design contributed something unique to the project, either by getting some (sometimes small) part very right, offering something slightly better than the previous version, or even showing us what wouldn’t work (and why). 



*Point 4: An iterative process is key*

You think you’ve created the perfect product. You’ve revised it many times and have poured a lot of thought into each small aspect of the design. Nothing could be better. Then, you get to user testing. Your user hears their tasks and gets started, but soon looks at you, confused. They’ve not done what you expected, and they don’t understand some component of your design. 

Even if you thought you’d designed exactly what they needed, there will always be things that you find unexpected. You are not your user! That’s why iterative testing and redesigning is so important. This happened many times over the process of designing Clink!. We thought we had made everything as straightforward and intuitive as possible, and that our [walkthrough and heuristic evaluations](https://clink-app.github.io/2019-11-04-Heuristic-Evaluation/) had identified all of the major usability issues. Our [first real user test](https://clink-app.github.io/2019-11-07-Usability-Testing-Check-In/) showed us we hadn’t! We made changes that we thought would address the problem, and similar things happened with our [later user tests](https://clink-app.github.io/2019-11-10-Usability-Testing-Review/)-- our users showed us how the things we thought we had fixed still weren’t perfect, and gave us feedback to make it better. We had made countless revisions by the end of the design process, but ended up with a much better [final product.](https://clink-app.github.io/2019-11-14-digital-mockup/)


*Point 5: Start by looking to understand the problem, not find a solution*

It can be easy to want to jump straight to solutions-- you think you know the problem, that’s why you chose to focus on it! Wrong. Consider all the different pieces of information you’re gathering throughout the [research process.](https://clink-app.github.io/2019-10-02-CI_review/) You’re interviewing, conducting contextual inquiries, looking at the products that currently exist, organizing, diagramming, and condensing all this information… there’s so much to be learned from your future users. This is all wasted if you think you know what they need before even asking them! 


*Conclusion*

The design process is involved and time-consuming for a reason: there are many necessary steps! The main thing I learned by going through this process with Clink! Is that each phase is important for its own reason, and skipping any phase would result in a less complete final product. 

Most importantly, listening to your users is essential, and most of the design phases are directly tied to this point. If you are designing, you are designing **for** someone: you need to know who they are and what they need, and they know what these things are better than you do! As the designer, your job is to listen, to piece together a coherent narrative from the disparate pieces of information they give you. This is what allows you to develop a solution that adds value. Never forget your user!
